Mapping is a [module](../modules/modules.md) for Omeka S which allows you to geolocate Omeka S items and add interactive maps to [Site Pages](../sites/site_pages).

To install Mapping, follow the instructions for [Installing Modules](../modules/modules.md#installing-modules) on the Modules documentation.

## Adding Geolocation to an Item

To add a map to a new or existing item, click to edit the item. Navigate to the  _Mapping_ tab to add a map to the item. Selecting the tab will open the map interface.

### Troubleshooting
If you would like to remove a map from an item, you must delete all the map modifications. First, click to delete each marker (click the Delete a Marker button, select the marker, click to save) and then click to clear the default center and zoom level (click the Clear the default and zoom level button. The map will return to a global view). Click to save the item and confirm that the map no longer appears.
