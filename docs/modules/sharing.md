# Sharing

The [Sharing module](https://omeka.org/s/modules/Sharing){target=_blank} allows you to add buttons to site pages which visitors can use to share and embed content from your site on social media or via email.

Currently, Sharing supports the following options:

- Facebook
- Twitter
- Tumblr
- Pinterest
- Email
- Embed codes.

Once Sharing has been installed and activated for an Omeka S install, it is available for all sites on the install. 

## Configuration

Sharing settings are configured on a site-by-site basis. Go to a site and click through to the Site Settings. There should be a section labelled "Sharing" (see the image below) with two options:

**Enable Sharing module for these methods**: gives a series of checkboxes, one for each service or option (Facebook, Twitter, etc.).

**Sharing buttons placement on the page**: sets the placement of the sharing buttons either at the top of the content (below the navigation and page header) or at the bottom (just above the footer). 

![Checkboxes for the sharing options listed above, in two rows](../modules/modulesfiles/sharing_options.png)

Ensure that the correct boxes are checked for your site. You can uncheck all of the boxes to turn off sharing for your site. Be sure to save your changes. 

## Public side

Sharing icons for enabled services and options will display on pages you build, as well as individual item/show pages on your site.

By default, the module will share the page title, the name of the site, and the name of the installation.
