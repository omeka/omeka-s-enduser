collections and exhibits online. We are working to make the core code
accessible and will continue to make accessibility for persons with
disabilities a priority as we develop the code. Omeka strives to adhere to `W3C
web design standards <http://www.w3.org/standards/>`_ and to be compliant with
`Section 508 <http://www.section508.gov/>`_ of the Americans with Disabilities

The Omeka S themes produced by the Omeka team have the following features to improve accessibility:

* `ARIA <http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria>`_ (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) landmarks for tabbing through page content, when not using a mouse or using a screen reader.
* Semantic HTML5 markup.

Please note that although the core code for Omeka S conform to the above standards, installations of Omeka S which have been customized or which are using non-RRCHNM modules and themes may lack some or all of these options. While we encourage developers to consider accessibility, we cannot guarantee that their code includes ARIA Landmarks, SkipNav, or other accessibility considerations.
