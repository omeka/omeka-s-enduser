msgid ""
"It does this by adding a link below selected properties that reads \"See all "
"items with this value\"; when clicked, the module returns the results of that "
"search (property value is equal to input). In function it is similar to the "

"The \"Use global configuration on admin side\" checkbox determines how the "
"properties available for *admin side* metadata browsing (on items and item "
"sets views) are determined: by aggregating the properties selected on all of "
"the sites in the installation (unchecked) or limited to only the properties."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/modules/metadatabrowse.md:19
msgid ""
"When the box is *unchecked*, metadata browse on the admin side (and only the "
"admin side) aggregates the metadata browse settings for all individual sites "
"and applies them to every item and item set in the installation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/modules/metadatabrowse.md:21
msgid ""
"Leaving the box unchecked allows installation users to browse the properties "
"on the admin side which they have set as key on their sites. For example, a "
"site about various artists might have the Metadata Browse enabled for "
"'Creator' (Dublin Core), while a site collecting conference papers might "
"enable Metadata Browse for 'presented at' (Bibliographic Ontology); with the "
"box unchecked, both 'Creator' and 'presented at' would have Metadata Browse "
"enabled on the admin views of all items and item sets on the installation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/modules/metadatabrowse.md:23
msgid ""
"When the box is *checked*, individual site settings still apply on the public "
"views of those sites, but are not used on the admin side. Instead, only those "
"properties selected in the Metadata Browse module configuration settings (the "
"current page) are used on the admin side. So if the global admin of the "
"installation example above checked the Global Configuration box and only "
"enabled the properties 'Title' and 'Creator', then the 'presented at' "
"property would not include a \"See all items with this value\" option on the "
"admin side item browse."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/modules/metadatabrowse.md:25
msgid ""
"Checking the box can be used to limit the number of properties which have "
"Metadata Browse enabled on the admin side. If, for example, the site about "
"various artists mentioned above was using Metadata Browse on every possible "
"property, those Metadata Browse links would still be visible on their site, "
"but would not show up on the admin side. Instead, the Global Administrator(s) "
"could decided which properties to enable browsing on for the admin side, thus "
"reducing visual clutter."
